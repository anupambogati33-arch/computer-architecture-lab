ab 8: VHDL Code for Sequential Circuits — Counters
Objective
To design and simulate a 4-bit synchronous up counter in VHDL.
To design and simulate a 4-bit synchronous up/down counter in VHDL.
Theory
A counter is a sequential circuit that cycles through a predefined sequence of states on each clock edge. Counters are built from flip-flops and are fundamental to timing, sequencing, and frequency division.

Term	Description
Synchronous Counter	All flip-flops are clocked simultaneously — faster and more reliable than ripple (asynchronous) counters.
Up Counter	Increments the count by 1 on each rising clock edge.
Up/Down Counter	Increments or decrements based on a direction control signal (UP).
Reset	An active-high synchronous reset returns the count to zero on the next rising clock edge.
A 4-bit counter cycles through values 0 to 15 (0000 to 1111 in binary). On reaching 15, an up counter wraps back to 0 on the next clock edge. Similarly, a down counter wraps from 0 back to 15.

Both counters in this lab use the NUMERIC_STD library to perform unsigned arithmetic on an internal unsigned signal, which is then converted back to std_logic_vector for the output port.

Output
The waveform was loaded in GTKWave. Signals CLK, RST, UP, COUNT_UP, and COUNT_UD were appended and COUNT signals were displayed in decimal format.

GTKWave Simulation Output

Observation: The up counter incremented from 0 to 15 continuously, wrapping back to 0 after each overflow. The up/down counter incremented correctly when UP = '1' and decremented correctly when UP = '0'. Both counters reset to 0 immediately on the next rising clock edge when RST = '1', confirming correct synchronous reset behavior.

Discussion and Conclusion
This lab demonstrated the design and simulation of two 4-bit synchronous counters in VHDL using the Behavioral modeling style. The up counter incremented its internal unsigned count on every rising clock edge, while the up/down counter used a direction control signal to switch between incrementing and decrementing modes. Both designs used a synchronous active-high reset to return the count to zero. The NUMERIC_STD library enabled clean arithmetic operations on unsigned signals with straightforward conversion to std_logic_vector for output. The GTKWave waveform confirmed correct counting, direction control, overflow wrapping, and reset behavior for both counters. This lab reinforced the practical application of sequential VHDL design and provided a foundation for building more complex state machines and timing circuits.
